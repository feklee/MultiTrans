Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected byte): 0.00 = 0 / 0
  Number of received / transmitted bytes: 0 / 91901
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received byte: 0000000 / 0000000
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a byte: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 0.00 bit/s + 2450.69 bit/s = 2450.69 bit/s

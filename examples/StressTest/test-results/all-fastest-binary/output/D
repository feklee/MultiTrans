Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected byte): 0.00 = 0 / 0
  Number of received / transmitted bytes: 0 / 91916
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received byte: 0000000 / 0000000
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a byte: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 0.00 bit/s + 2451.09 bit/s = 2451.09 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected byte): 0.00 = 0 / 46840
  Number of received / transmitted bytes: 46840 / 46846
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received byte: 240 = 1111000 / 85 = 0101010
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a byte: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 1249.07 bit/s + 1249.23 bit/s = 2498.29 bit/s

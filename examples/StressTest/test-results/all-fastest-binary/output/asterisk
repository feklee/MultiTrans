Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected byte): 0.00 = 0 / 46791
  Number of received / transmitted bytes: 46791 / 46980
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received byte: 240 = 1111000 / 66 = 0100001
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a byte: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 1247.76 bit/s + 1252.80 bit/s = 2500.56 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected byte): 0.00 = 0 / 46830

Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 199060
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 199060 / 200773
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / % = 0010010
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 5308.27 bit/s + 5353.95 bit/s = 10662.21 bit/s

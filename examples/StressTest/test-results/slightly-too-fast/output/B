Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.01 = 3645 / 396636
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 396636 / 398897
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / j = 0110101
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 1624
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 10576.96 bit/s + 10637.25 bit/s = 21214.21 bit/s

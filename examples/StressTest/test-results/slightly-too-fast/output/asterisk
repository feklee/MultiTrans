Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.01 = 3756 / 396012
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 396012 / 400973
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / % = 0010010
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 1707
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 10560.32 bit/s + 10692.61 bit/s = 21252.93 bit/s

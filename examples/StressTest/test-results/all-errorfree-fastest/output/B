Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 48442
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 48442 / 48450
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / ( = 0010100
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 1291.79 bit/s + 1292.00 bit/s = 2583.79 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 0
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 0 / 95426
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: 0000000 / 0000000
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 0.00 bit/s + 2544.69 bit/s = 2544.69 bit/s
Pin 8:

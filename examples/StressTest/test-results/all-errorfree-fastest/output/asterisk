Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 48450
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 48450 / 48648
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / f = 0110011
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 1292.00 bit/s + 1297.28 bit/s = 2589.28 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 48488

  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / E = 0100010
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 1293.01 bit/s + 1294.08 bit/s = 2587.09 bit/s
Pin 8:

Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 199514
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 199514 / 199533
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / O = 0100111
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 5320.37 bit/s + 5320.88 bit/s = 10641.25 bit/s

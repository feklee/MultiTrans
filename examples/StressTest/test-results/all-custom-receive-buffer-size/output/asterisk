Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 38263
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 38263 / 38130
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / C = 0100001
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 3468
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 1020.35 bit/s + 1016.80 bit/s = 2037.15 bit/s

Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected byte): 0.00 = 0 / 199010
  Number of received / transmitted bytes: 199010 / 199825
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received byte: 240 = 1111000 / 51 = 0011001
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a byte: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 5306.93 bit/s + 5328.67 bit/s = 10635.60 bit/s

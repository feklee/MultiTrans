Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 38450
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 38450 / 38073
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / N = 0100111
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 3398
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 1025.33 bit/s + 1015.28 bit/s = 2040.61 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 0

Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.08 = 2686 / 35547
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 35547 / 38521
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / ' = 0010011
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 4779
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 947.92 bit/s + 1027.23 bit/s = 1975.15 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 0

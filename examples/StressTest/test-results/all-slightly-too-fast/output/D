Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 0
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 0 / 188513
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: 0000000 / 0000000
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 0.00 bit/s + 5027.01 bit/s = 5027.01 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 56 / 96953

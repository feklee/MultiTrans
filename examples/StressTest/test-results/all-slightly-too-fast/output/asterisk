Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 96883
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 96883 / 97280
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / \ = 0101110
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 2583.55 bit/s + 2594.13 bit/s = 5177.68 bit/s
Pin 3:

Pin 2:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 50 / 96887
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 96887 / 96921
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: } = 0111110 / O = 0100111
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 22
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 2583.65 bit/s + 2584.56 bit/s = 5168.21 bit/s
Pin 3:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 0
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 0 / 188273
  Number of bit collisions: 0
  Number of receive buffer overflows: 0
  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: 0000000 / 0000000
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 0.00 bit/s + 5020.61 bit/s = 5020.61 bit/s
Pin 8:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 0

  Number of elements currently in receive buffer: 0
  First / Last received character: 0000000 / 0000000
  Number of times noise was detected when reading a character: 0
  Measured data rate (downstream + upstream): 0.00 bit/s + 5020.19 bit/s = 5020.19 bit/s
Pin 9:
  Error ratio (error = unexpected character): 0.00 = 0 / 0
  Number of received / transmitted characters: 0 / 188257
  Number of bit collisions: 0
